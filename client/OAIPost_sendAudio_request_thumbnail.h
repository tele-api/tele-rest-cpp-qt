/*
 * OAIPost_sendAudio_request_thumbnail.h
 *
 * Thumbnail of the file sent; can be ignored if thumbnail generation for the file is supported server-side. The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 kB in size. A thumbnail&#39;s width and height should not exceed 320. Ignored if the file is not uploaded using multipart/form-data. Thumbnails can&#39;t be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file, so you can pass “attach://\\&lt;file\\_attach\\_name\\&gt;” if the thumbnail was uploaded using multipart/form-data under \\&lt;file\\_attach\\_name\\&gt;.

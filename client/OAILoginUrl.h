/*
 * OAILoginUrl.h
 *
 * This object represents a parameter of the inline keyboard button used to automatically authorize a user. Serves as a great replacement for the [Telegram Login Widget](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login) when the user is coming from Telegram. All the user needs to do is tap/click a button and confirm that they want to log in:  Telegram apps support these buttons as of [version 5.7](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots#meet-seamless-web-bots).  Sample bot: [@discussbot](https://t.me/discussbot)
